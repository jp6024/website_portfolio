                <p id="excerpt"> Kaz Brekker didn’t need a reason. Those were the words whispered on the streets of
                    Ketterdam, in the
                    taverns and coffeehouses, in the dark and bleeding alleys of the pleasure district known as the
                    Barrel.</p>
                <p id="excerpt">
                    The boy they called Dirtyhands didn’t need a reason any more than he needed permission—to
                    break a leg, sever an alliance, or change a man’s fortunes with the turn of a card.
                </p id="excerpt">
                <p id="excerpt">Of course they were wrong, Inej considered as she crossed the bridge
                    over the black waters of the Beurskanal to the deserted main square that fronted
                    the Exchange. Every act of violence was deliberate, and every favor came with enough strings
                    attached to stage a puppet show. Kaz <i>always</i> had his reasons. Inej
                    could just never be sure they were good ones. Especially tonight.</p>
                <p id="excerpt">Inej checked her knives, silently reciting their names as she always did when she
                    thought there might be trouble. It was a practical habit, but a comfort, too. The blades were her
                    companions. She liked knowing they were ready for whatever the night might bring.</p>
                <p id="excerpt">
                    She saw Kaz and the others gathered near the great stone arch that
                    marked the eastern entrance to the Exchange. Three words had been carved into
                    the rock above them: <i>Enjent, Voorhent, Almhent.</i> Industry, Integrity, Prosperity.
                </p>

                <p id="excerpt">
                    She kept close to the shuttered storefronts that lined the square, avoiding the pockets of
                    flickering gaslight cast by the streetlamps. As she moved, she
                    inventoried the crew Kaz had brought with him: Dirix, Rotty, Muzzen and Keeg,
                    Anika and Pim, and his chosen seconds for tonight’s parley, Jesper and Big Bolliger. They jostled
                    and bumped each other, laughing, stamping their feet against
                    the cold snap that had surprised the city this week, the last gasp of winter before
                    spring began in earnest. They were all bruisers and brawlers, culled from the
                    younger members of the Dregs, the people Kaz trusted most. Inej noted the glint
                    of knives tucked into their belts, lead pipes, weighted chains, axe handles studded
                    with rusty nails, and here and there, the oily gleam of a gun barrel. She slipped
                    silently into their ranks, scanning the shadows near the Exchange for signs of
                    Black Tip spies.
                </p>
                <p id="excerpt">
                    “Three ships!” Jesper was saying. “The Shu sent them. They were just
                    sitting in First Harbor, cannons out, red flags flying, stuffed to the sails with gold.”
                </p>
                <p id="excerpt">
                    Big Bolliger gave a low whistle. “Would have liked to see that.”
                </p>

                <p id="excerpt">
                    “Would have liked to <i>steal</i> that,” replied Jesper. “Half the Merchant
                    Council was down there flapping and squawking, trying to figure out what to do.”
                </p>

                <p id="excerpt">“Don’t they want the Shu paying their debts?” Big Bolliger asked.</p>

                <p id="excerpt">
                    Kaz shook his head, dark hair glinting in the lamplight. He was a collection of hard lines and
                    tailored edges—sharp jaw, lean build, wool coat snug
                    across his shoulders. “Yes and no,” he said in his rock salt rasp. “It’s always good to
                    have a country in debt to you. Makes for friendlier negotiations.”
                </p>
                <p id="excerpt">
                    “Maybe the Shu are done being friendly,” said Jesper. “They didn’t have
                    to send all that treasure at once. You think they stuck that trade ambassador?”
                </p>

                <p id="excerpt">
                    Kaz’s eyes found Inej unerringly in the crowd. Ketterdam had been
                    buzzing about the assassination of the ambassador for weeks. It had nearly
                    destroyed Kerch-Zemeni relations and sent the Merchant Council into an uproar.
                    The Zemeni blamed the Kerch. The Kerch suspected the Shu. Kaz didn’t care who
                    was responsible; the murder fascinated him because he couldn’t figure out how
                    it had been accomplished. In one of the busiest corridors of the Stadhall, in full
                    view of more than a dozen government officials, the Zemeni trade ambassador
                    had stepped into a washroom. No one else had entered or left, but when his aide
                    knocked on the door a few minutes later, there had been no answer. When they’d
                    broken down the door, they’d found the ambassador facedown on the white tiles,
                    a knife in his back, the sink still running.
                </p>

                <p id="excerpt">
                    Kaz had sent Inej to investigate the premises after hours. The washroom
                    had no other entrance, no windows or vents, and even Inej hadn’t mastered the
                    art of squeezing herself through the plumbing. Yet the Zemeni ambassador was
                    dead. Kaz hated a puzzle he couldn’t solve, and he and Inej had concocted a hundred theories to
                    account for the murder—none of which satisfied. But they had
                    more pressing problems tonight.
